# ArchTag

**ArchTag** is a company that provides an **SASS** with which you can _manage_, _give work_ and spectate what your employers are working on, if they are filling up their quotes, when they come and go from work and so much more. This project is created specially for the construction branch.

#### This Repo is the repo of the ArchTag webapp. In here is the ReactJS Webapp as well as the Express server that will be hosting this app.
